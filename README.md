Data Collection: Gather a dataset containing images of both bald and non-bald individuals.

Data Preprocessing: Standardize image size, color, and orientation for consistency.

Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features such as hair presence, scalp color, and head shape from the preprocessed images.

Model Selection: Choose a suitable machine learning model, often a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), for image classification tasks.

Training: Train the selected model on the preprocessed dataset to learn to classify images as bald or non-bald.

Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate evaluation dataset.

Deployment: Integrate the trained model into real-world applications to automatically detect baldness in images or videos.
